# FIR_Filter_Design
This project is used to implement FIR (Finite Duration Impulse Response) filter design using given specification in the project description. When we try to implement filter design using windowing method this is also call as Fourier series method, there are more techniques but in here we use most famous windowing method call as Kaiser windowing method. Using MATLABR2018a software and building functions these calculations for designing were implemented.

Fully described paper will be uploaded when the matlab implementation is succesfully over.
